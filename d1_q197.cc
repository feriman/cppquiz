/*
 * There are two variables named j here. The first is the global one, the
 * second is local to main. A variable is in scope from the point of its
 * declaration until the end of the region in which it was declared, except
 * for when another variable with the same name is in scope.
 *
 * It's easiest to first look at the scope of the local j declared inside
 * main, which extends from the , to the }. The scope of the global j is
 * from when it was declared until the end of the program, except for when
 * the local j is in scope.
 *
 * So the reference i refers to the global j, since the local j is not yet
 * in scope. When we set j=2, we modify the local j, and i is not affected.
 *
 * This example is almost identical to [basic.scope.declarative]#2 [1] in
 * the C++ standard, which has the following explanation:
 *
 * 		the identifier j is declared twice as a name (and used twice). The
 * 		declarative region of the first j includes the entire example. The
 * 		potential scope of the first j begins immediately after that j and
 * 		extends to the end of the program, but its (actual) scope excludes
 * 		the text between the , and }. The declarative region of the second
 * 		declaration of j (the j immediately before the semicolon) includes
 * 		all the text between { and }, but its potential scope excludes the
 * 		declaration of i. The scope of the second declaration of j is the
 * 		same as its potential scope.
