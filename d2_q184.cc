/*
 * Why does overload resolution not pick the obviously better void f(int),
 * but instead void f(double) which requires a floating-integral conversion
 * from int to double?
 *
 * It turns out that void f(int) isn't even in scope, and is not considered
 * for overload resolution at all. When the name f is introduced in
 * Derived, it hides the name f that was introduced in Base.
 *
 * [basic.scope] [1] in the C++ standard is dedicated to scope.
 * [basic.scope.hiding]#1 [2] and #3 has some hints about what's going on
 * in our case:
 *
 * #1: "A name can be hidden by an explicit declaration of that same name
 * in a nested declarative region or derived class (#13.2)"
 * #3: "The declaration of a member in a derived class (Clause 13) hides
 * the declaration of a member of a base class of the same name; see #13.2"
 *
 * Both of these refer to [class.member.lookup] [3], so let's explore the
 * details about how the name f is looked up in a class scope C:
 *
 * [class.member.lookup]#4:
 * "If C contains a declaration of the name f, the declaration set contains
 * every declaration of f declared in C that satisfies the requirements of
 * the language construct in which the lookup occurs. (...) If the
 * resulting declaration set is not empty, the subobject set contains C
 * itself, and calculation is complete."
 *
 * So when looking for a declaration of f and finding Derived::f, the
 * calculation is complete, and Base is not examined at all. If no f was
 * found in Derived, we would continue with [class.member.lookup]#5 [5]:
 *
 * "Otherwise (i.e., C does not contain a declaration of f or the resulting
 * declaration set is empty), S(f,C) is initially empty. If C has base
 * classes, calculate the lookup set for f in each direct base class
 * subobject Bi, and merge each such lookup set S(f, Bi) in turn into S(f,
 * C).
 *
 * But since Derived does indeed contain a declaration of f, we never get
 * around to looking at Base.
