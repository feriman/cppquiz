/*
 * '3' and '2' are both ordinary character literals, with type char. But we
 * don't know which values they have! That's up to the implementation:
 *
 * [lex.ccon]#2 [1]:
 *
 * An ordinary character literal that contains a single c-char
 * representable in the execution character set has type char, with value
 * equal to the numerical value of the encoding of the c-char in the
 * execution character set.
 *
 * operator- subtracts the value of the second operand from the value of
 * the first operand. But now can we know what the result is, when we don't
 * know the values of the operands?
 *
 * [lex.charset]#3 [2]:
 *
 * In both the source and execution basic character sets, the value of each
 * character after 0 in the above list of decimal digits shall be one
 * greater than the value of the previous.
 *
 * (The "above list of decimal digits" is simply 0123456789.)
 *
 * So we know that the difference between '3' and '2' is 1, even if we
 * don't know their actual values. Importantly, this is only true for
 * decimal digits, and not for instance for regular letters. There is no
 * guarantee that 'b' - 'a' is 1.
