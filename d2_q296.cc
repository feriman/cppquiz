/*
 * You are actually allowed to specify fewer initializers than a
 * struct/class has members, as long as that struct/class is an aggregate.
 *
 * [dcl.init.aggr]#8 [1]:
 *
 * If there are fewer initializer-clauses in the list than there are
 * elements in a non-union aggregate, then each element not explicitly
 * initialized is initialized as follows:
 * -- If the element has a default member initializer (12.2), the element
 *  is initialized from that initializer.
 * -- Otherwise, if the element is not a reference, the element is copy-
 *  initialized from an empty initializer list (11.6.4).
 * -- Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.
 *
 * In this case, the second bullet point applies, and the program is
 * actually well formed. You may not even get a warning about this, for
 * instance both gcc and clang requires -Wextra to warn about it.
 *
 * The rule that allows to few initializers only applies to a "non-union
 * aggregate". Is S a non-union aggregate? It's a struct, so it's not a
 * union. Is it also an aggregate? An aggregate is basically any array or
 * class with nothing "special" going on in initialization, such as
 * constructors etc.
 *
 * [dcl.init.aggr]#1 [2]:
 *
 * An aggregate is an array or a class with
 * -- no user-provided, explicit, or inherited constructors,
 * -- no private or protected non-static data members,
 * -- no virtual functions, and
 * -- no virtual, private, or protected base classes
 *
 * struct S has none of the above, so it's an aggregate.
