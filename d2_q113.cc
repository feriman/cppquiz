/*
 * Here we have three calls to f. Which function is selected for each call?
 * [temp.over]#1 [1] is surprisingly readable:
 *
 * A function template can be overloaded either by (non-template) functions
 * of its name or by (other) function templates of the same name.
 *
 * The function template f is in our case overloaded by the non-template
 * void f(int). It goes on:
 *
 * When a call to that name is written [...], template argument deduction
 * [is] performed for each function template to find the template argument
 * values (if any) that can be used with that function template to
 * instantiate a function template specialization that can be invoked with
 * the call arguments.
 *
 * So in the three cases above, we first do template argument deduction,
 * giving double, int and int, respectively.
 *
 * Then:
 *
 * For each function template, if the argument deduction and checking
 * succeeds, the template-arguments [...] are used to synthesize the
 * declaration of a single function template specialization which is added
 * to the candidate functions set to be used in overload resolution.
 *
 * So in all the three cases above, a specialization of the function
 * template f is added to the candidates to overload resolution, with T
 * equal to double, int and int, respectively.
 *
 * Now look at each call:
 *
 * For f(0.0), T is deduced as double, and a specialization void f(double)
 * is added as a candidate for overload resulution. The other candidate is
 * the non-template function void f(int). The one taking a double is a
 * better match, and 1 is printed.
 *
 * For f(0), T is deduced as int, and a specialization void f(int) is added
 * as a candidate for overload resolution. The other candidate is the non-
 * template function void f(int). Both are equally good matches, so is the
 * program ill-formed?
 *
 * [over.match.best]#1 [2]:
 *
 * F1 is defined to be a better function than another viable function F2
 * if [...]
 * F1 is not a function template specialization and F2 is a function
 * template specialization
 *
 * void f(int) is not a function template specialization, and template<>
 * void f(int) is, so the former is selected, and 3 is printed.
 *
 * Finally we get to f<>(0). <> is an (empty) template argument list, which
 * can be specified for template functions, but not for non-template
 * functions. So in this case, the non-template function is not an option,
 * we explicitly ask for the function template. This is also described in a
 * note in [temp.arg.explicit]#4 [3]:
 *
 * An empty template argument list can be used to indicate that a given use
 * refers to a specialization of a function template even when a non-
 * template function is visible that would otherwise be used.
 *
 * T is deduced to int, the specialization for int is the only candidate,
 * and 2 is printed.
