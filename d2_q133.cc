/*
 * On the first line of main(), d1 is initialized, in the order A, B, C, D.
 * That order is defined by [class.base.init]#13 [1]:
 *
 * "-- First, and only for the constructor of the most derived class (4.5),
 * virtual base classes are initialized in the order they appear on a
 * depth-first left-to-right traversal of the directed acyclic graph of
 * base classes, where "left-to-right" is the order of appearance of the
 * base classes in the derived class base-specifier-list.
 * -- Then, direct base classes are initialized in declaration order as
 *  they appear in the base-specifier-list
 * (...)
 * -- Finally, the compound-statement of the constructor body is executed."
 *
 * So the output is ABCD.
 *
 * On the second line, d2 is initialized. But why are the constructors (as
 * opposed to the copy constructors) for the base classes, called? Why do
 * we see ADCd instead of abcd?
 *
 * As it turns out, an implicitly-defined copy constructor would have
 * called the copy constructor of its bases ([class.copy.ctor]#14 [2]: "The
 * implicitly-defined copy-move constructor for a non-union class X
 * performs a memberwise copy/move of its bases and members."). But when
 * you provide a user-defined copy constructor, this is something you have
 * to do explicitly.
