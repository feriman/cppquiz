/*
 * As defined in [basic.scope.pdecl]#1 [1], the point of name declaration

 * variable p with the address of an existing variable, even if it is its
 * own address.
 *
 * The value of p is unknown, but can not be a null pointer value. The cast
 * must thus evaluate to 1 and initialise the temporary bool as true.
