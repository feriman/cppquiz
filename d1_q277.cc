/*
 * "" is not completely empty, it has a terminating \0:
 *
 * [lex.string]#14 [1]
 *
 * \0 is appended to every string literal so that programs that scan a
 * string can find its end.
 *
 * Now what's the type of ""? [lex.string]#6 and #8 [2]:
 *
 * a string-literal that does not begin with an encoding-prefix is an
 * ordinary string literal, and is initialized with the given characters.
 *
 * Ordinary string literals (...) are also referred to as narrow string
 * literals. A narrow string literal has type "array of n const char",
 * where n is the size of the string as defined below
 *
 * So the type of "" is "array of n const char". It's size is defined in
 * [lex.string]#15 [3]:
 *
 * The size of a narrow string literal is the total number of escape
 * sequences and other characters, plus at least one for the multibyte
 * encoding of each universal-character-name, plus one for the terminating
 * \0.
 *
 * There are no escape sequences, no other characters and no
 * universal-character-names (unicode U... constructs), so the size of the
 * array is just 1 for the implicit terminating \0.
 *
 * Finally, what does sizeof return when applied to an array?
 *
 * [expr.sizeof]#2 [4]:
 *
 * When applied to an array, the result is the total number of bytes in the
 * array. This implies that the size of an array of n elements is n times
 * the size of an element.
 *
 * Our array is 1 elements long, so it returns 1 times the size of the
 * element. How big is the element? [expr.sizeof]#1 [5]:
 *
 * sizeof(char), sizeof(signed char) and sizeof(unsigned char) are 1
 *
 * So we have one element with size 1, and the program prints 1.
